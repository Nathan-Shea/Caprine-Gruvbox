# Caprine-Gruvbox

## Install
With snap, custom.css goes in \
`~/snap/caprine/current/.config/Caprine` \
otherwise it should be in \
`~/.config/Caprine` 

## Problems
I need to work out how to override the standard facebook blue and custom chat themes.

## Thanks to:
the official dracula for a guide to what to go off for the custom.css file.
